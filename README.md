# Homework system frontend

For my Bachelor Degree project, I developed a **website** and **3D game** to make **homework more engaging** for students. Teachers could assign tests via the website, which students would complete through the 3D game interface.

**Here you can find a website part.**

## Teachers use:

- Login
- Create class
- Create test with questions and answers
- Assign test to class
- Analyse results
- Export grades to a separate file

## Students use:

- Login
- Look for homework
- Choose to either play a **game** or do a **test**
- If chooses to play - redirects to game window
- If chooses to do a test - redirects to test page
- Questions appear as cubes in this 3D game world
- After completing homework, grade and answers could be found back in the website
- Leaderboard based on points and time (for separate homework and for all homeworks)

Gamifying homework can significantly improve students’ motivation and focus. The "Goose" platform was designed to boost engagement by introducing a bit of competition and interactive gameplay.
