# Homework system frontend

For my Bachelor Degree project, I developed a website and 3D game to make homework more engaging for students. Teachers could assign tests via the website, which students would complete through the 3D game interface.

Here you can find a website part.

## Teachers use:

- Login
- Create class
- Create test with questions and answers
- Assign test to class
- Analyse results
- Export grades to a separate file

## Students use:

- Login
- Look for homework
- Choose to either play or do a test
- If play - redirects to game window
- Questions appear as cubes in this 3D gmae world
- After completing homework grade and answers could be found back in the website
- Leaderboard based on points and time (per separate homework and per all homeworks)

The gamification of homeworks is a big changer in students motyvation and ability to concentrate. The "Goose" platform was designed to rise motivation by adding a little bit of competition and action.
